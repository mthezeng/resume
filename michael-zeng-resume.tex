    \begin{itemize} 
		\item Developed Python navigation backend designed to identify the most optimal vacuuming path for an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner
		\item Integrated Google Cartographer SLAM with a LiDAR laser scanner in Robot Operating System (ROS)
		\item Integrated computer vision through a ZED stereo camera to allow the robot to detect and avoid obstacles while driving autonomously, using the ROS package zed-ros-wrapper
		\item Designed and deployed a website hosted on an AWS Elastic Compute instance which allows the user to teleoperate the robotic vacuum cleaner remotely through the Internet based on sensor and camera information

    \begin{itemize} 
		\item Designed objects to store and compare different poker hands efficiently
		\item Developed an algorithm that applies the rules of Texas hold'em to determine the winning hand once the action in a round is complete, given all cards available
		\item Implemented a web interface that allows users to create accounts and maintain profiles
		%\item Implemented an algorithm that calculates a player's All-In Expected Value (EV), or the amount of money they can expect to earn in the long run if they bet all their chips on the current hand

    \begin{itemize}
	\item Implemented a lexer which takes the C code and converts them into tokens for various syntactic structures, discarding comments and excess whitespace
	\item Developed a parser which arranges the tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST), which defines the structure of the program in terms of the lexed tokens, supporting if/else statements, for loops, call expressions, function declarations, variable declarations, binary expressions, literals, return statements, and others
	\item Developed a code generation program which converts the AST into RISC-V assembly code that can be run immediately on a RISC-V processor

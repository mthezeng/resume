    \begin{itemize} 
		\item Developed path planner and navigation stack in Python designed to identify the most optimal vacuuming path for an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner given 2D map information generated from a laser scanner
		\item Integrated computer vision through a stereo camera in Robot Operating System (ROS) to allow the robot to detect and avoid obstacles while driving autonomously

		\item Designed objects to store and compare different poker hands efficiently
		\item Developed an algorithm that applies the rules of Texas hold'em to determine the winning hand once the action in a round is complete, given all cards available
		\item Implemented a web interface using the Django web framework, allowing users to create accounts, maintain profiles, and store their hand histories
		%\item Implemented an algorithm that calculates a player's All-In Expected Value (EV), or the amount of money they can expect to earn in the long run if they bet all their chips on the current hand

	\item \textbf{Enigma:} Implemented an improved Enigma machine, a German device used to encrypt messages during World War II, avoiding the cryptographic weaknesses of the original machine
	\item \textbf{Amazons:} Implemented a strategy game played on a chess board where users can play human vs human or human vs an AI made using a game tree to calculate the best moves

	\item \textbf{Performance programming:} Utilized Intel intrinsic SIMD instructions and OpenMP to parallelize operations in C code, resulting in a 16x speed-up in an image recognition algorithm
